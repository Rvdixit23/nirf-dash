#### **Please Note** ***To understand the scores and how they are computed, please refer to the NIRF website [here](https://www.nirfindia.org/nirfpdfcdn/2021/framework/Engineering.pdf).*** Metrics used for NIRF rankings are designed to be easily verifiable.
###### For example, a high teacher to student ratio doesn't really mean the teachers are good. **Here are a list of metrics completely ignored by NIRF criteria which might matter to you.**
###### Quality of teaching (different from qualification of teaching), Campus, Hostel, How good/safe the city is, Food, Fees and Cost of living, College activity clubs, Annual Fests, Peer Crowd, Qualifying exam and much more.
