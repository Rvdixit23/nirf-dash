# NIRF Dash
---
## NIRF Rankings, but with your criteria
So that you can select your college based on what you want instead of what the Ministry of Education has decided.

### **Please Note** **To understand the scores and how they are computed, please refer to the NIRF website [here](https://www.nirfindia.org/nirfpdfcdn/2021/framework/Engineering.pdf).** 
- Metrics used for NIRF rankings are designed to be easily verifiable.
- For example, a high teacher to student ratio doesn't really mean the teachers are good. **Here are a list of metrics completely ignored by NIRF criteria which might matter to you.**
- Quality of teaching (different from qualification of teaching), Campus, Hostel, How good/safe the city is, Food, Fees and Cost of living, College activity clubs, Annual Fests, Peer Crowd, Qualifying exam and much more.
